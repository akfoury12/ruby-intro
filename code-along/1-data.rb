# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# # Numbers
# puts 3
# puts 5

# Perform simple math with numbers

# puts 5 + 2
# puts 5.0 / 2.05
# puts 5%2

# Order of Ops

# puts (2 + 5) *5

# # Strings
# puts "jello, world!"

# Combine strings together
# puts "jello" + ", world!"
# puts "tacos" * 400
# puts "tacos" + 3.to_s

# Variables
# a = 1000
# puts a

# Combine strings and variables

greeting = "Hello #{first_name}"
puts greeting

# String manipulation

puts "tihsho".reverse
